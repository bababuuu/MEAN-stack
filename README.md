# MEAN-stack
Twitter-like webapp built using MEAN (mongo, express, angular, nodejs) as shown in microsoft virtual academy tutorial


### Credits to 'https://github.com/hwz/chirp' for the twitter clone
The examples codes given on the link above may not work for angular 1.6 (such as syntax changes for handling 'http' success/failure callbacks). Thus created a 'working' example from scratch for purpose of learning and sharing. Please use the working code in 'backend' folder :))

###Installation instructions (for noobs like me) to run locally (not cloud)
1. Navigate 'backend' folder. 
2. While in directory run `npm install` and `npm run`
3. Install mongodb and run database
4. Once server is started, run localhost:3000 url.
