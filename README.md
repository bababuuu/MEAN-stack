### Credits to 'https://github.com/hwz/chirp'
The examples codes given may not work for angular 1.6 (such as syntax changes for handling 'http' success/failure callbacks). Thus created a 'working' example from scratch for purpose of learning and sharing. Please use the working code in 'backend' folder :))
