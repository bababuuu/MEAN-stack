# MEAN-stack
Twitter-like webapp built using MEAN (mongo, express, angular, nodejs) as shown in microsoft virtual academy tutorial


### Credits to 'https://github.com/hwz/chirp' for the twitter clone
The examples codes given on the link above may not work for angular 1.6 as the tutorial was built using an older version some syntax are deprecated (such as syntax changes for handling 'http' success()/failure() callbacks and now used with then() instead). Thus created a 'working' example from scratch for purpose of learning and sharing. Please use the working code in 'backend' folder :))

###Installation instructions (for noobs like me) to run locally (not cloud)
1. Navigate 'backend' folder. 
2. While in directory run `npm install` to install all its dependencies it needs.
3. Run `npm start` to start server.
4. Install mongodb and run database.
5. Go to localhost:3000 url to use app.
